# 1: Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

# def even_or_odd(number):
#     if number % 2 == 0:
#         return 'Even'
#     else:
#         return 'Odd'

# 2: This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

# def multiply(a, b):
#     return a * b 

# # 3: In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

# def make_negative( number ):
#     if number<=0:
#          return number
#     elif number>0:
#         return -number

# def make_negative( number ):
#     return -abs(number)
    
# 4: You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20 Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0

# def positive_sum(arr):
#     positiveSum = 0
#     for num in arr:
#         if num>0:
#             positiveSum += num
#     return positiveSum

# 5 Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

# def bool_to_word(boolean):
#     return 'Yes' if boolean else 'No'
